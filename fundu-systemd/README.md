# Overview

This crate provides a simple to use and blazingly fast parser based on [fundu](../README.md) aiming for full compatibility with
the [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) time span format as specified in
their [documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.time.html).

`fundu-systemd` can parse rust strings like

| `&str` | Duration |
| -- | -- |
| `"2 h"` | `Duration::positive(2 * 60 * 60, 0)` |
| `"2hours"` |`Duration::positive(2 * 60 * 60, 0)` |
| `"second"` |`Duration::positive(1, 0)` |
| `"48hr"` |`Duration::positive(48 * 60 * 60, 0)` |
| `"1y 12month"` | `Duration::positive(63_115_200, 0)` |
| `"999us +1d"` |`Duration::positive(86_400, 999_000)` |
| `"55s500ms"` | `Duration::positive(55, 500_000_000)` |
| `"300ms20s 5day"` |`Duration::positive(20 + 5 * 60 * 60 * 24, 300_000_000)` |
| `"123456789"` |`Duration::positive(123_456_789, 0)` |
| `"infinity"` |`Duration::positive(u64::MAX, 999_999_999)` |

into a `Duration`.

Note that `fundu` parses into its own `Duration` which is a superset of other `Durations` like
[`std::time::Duration`], [`chrono::Duration`] and [`time::Duration`]. See the
[documentation](https://docs.rs/fundu/latest/fundu/index.html#fundus-duration) how to easily
handle the conversion between these durations.

# Audience

This crate is for you if you

- seek a fast and reliable systemd compatible duration parser
- want it to simply just work without diving into customizations
- just like the systemd format
- ...

This crate is not for you if you want to customize the parser to a format which would not be
compatible with `systemd`. See the main [fundu](../README.md) project, if you want to use a parser
tailored to your needs.

# Description of the Format

Supported time units:

- `nsec`, `ns` (can be switched off)
- `usec`, `us`, `Âµs`
- `msec,` `ms`
- `seconds`, `second`, `sec`, `s`
- `minutes`, `minute`, `min`, `m`
- `hours`, `hour`, `hr`, `h`
- `days`, `day`, `d`
- `weeks`, `week`, `w`
- `months`, `month`, `M` (defined as `30.44` days or a `1/12` year)
- `years`, `year`, `y` (defined as `365.25` days)

A summary of the rest of the format:

- Only simple numbers (like in `"123 days"`) without fraction (like in `"1.2 days"`) and exponent
(like in `"3e9 days"`) are allowed
- For numbers without a time unit (like `"1234"`) the default time unit is usually `second` but can
be changed since in some case systemd uses a different granularity.
- Time units without a number (like in `"second"`) are allowed and a value of `1` is assumed.
- The parsed duration represents the value exactly (without rounding errors as would occur in floating point calculations) as it is specified in the source string (just like systemd).
- The maximum supported duration has `u64::MAX` seconds (`18_446_744_073_709_551_615`) and
`999_999_999` nano seconds.
- The special value `"infinity"` evaluates to the maximum supported duration what effectively is
around `584_542_046_090` years.
- parsed durations larger than the maximum supported duration (like `"100000000000000years"`)
saturate at the maximum supported duration
- Negative durations are not allowed, also no intermediate negative durations like in `"5day -1ms"`
although the final duration would not be negative.
- Any whitespace between the number and the time unit (like in `"1 \n sec"`) and multiple durations
(like in `"1week \n 2minutes"`) is ignored and follows the posix definition of whitespace which is:
    - Space (`' '`)
    - Horizontal Tab (`'\x09'`)
    - Line Feed (`'\x0A'`)
    - Vertical Tab (`'\x0B'`)
    - Form Feed (`'\x0C'`)
    - Carriage Return (`'\x0D'`)

Please see also the systemd
[documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.time.html) for a
description of their format.

# Known issues

## Maximum duration

### Issue

Instead of returning an error for durations larger than the maximum duration, fundu saturates at its
maximum supported duration of `u64::MAX` seconds and `999_999_999` nano seconds. In contrast,
systemd's maximum supported duration is `u64::MAX` micro seconds.

### Mitigation

Check if the parsed duration is larger than `u64::MAX` micro seconds and perform the error handling
manually
